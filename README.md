Assignments I have completed from CS121 at University of Idaho

## Programs Explained:

### Program #2:
A program to read and dynamically allocate a multidimensional array in which a "robot" will randomly traverse. The program takes in the size of the grid, along with the max steps the "robot" is allowed to take. The program will terminate when either every point is visited, or when the "robot" has reached the max steps available and can take no more. Then, the program will output a grid showing how many times each point in the array was visitited, the amount of steps taken, each node that was visited the maximum amount of tiems allowed, and also what that maximum value was.

### Program #3:
Program that uses a stack, implemented using a linked list, to turn an infix expression into its equivalent postfix form. 

### Program #4
Maze traversal program using queues and dynamically allocated arrays. The program retrieves mazes from a text file, and then solves them, outputting the different paths it takes to reach the goal. The program ends after the goal is found, and if there is another maze in the text file, it will begin solving that one. The program continues this loop until every maze is solved.

### Program #5:
A program to create and hold the information to a small database. The database will hold information regarding TV shows; It will hold the show names, broad- cast years, category, and the actor/actress names. The program will store the information using a binary search tree. The binary search tree will be sorted using the TV show name as the key, and the rest of the information regarding that show will be stored in the same node.
